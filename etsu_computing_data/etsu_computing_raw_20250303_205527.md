## Accelerated Bachelors to Masters Program

**URL:** https://www.etsu.edu/cbat/computing/undergraduate_programs/accelerated_bs_to_ms.php

Program Description

ETSU allows undergraduates to enroll in graduate coursework for up to 12 credit hours

                     during their final year of undergraduate study. Benefits of doing this include

Beginning graduate work while still an undergraduate

Counting up to 12 credits of graduate work towards the undergraduate degree

Paying the undergraduate rate for graduate courses during the final year of undergraduate

                        study

Earning a Master's degree (on average) one semester earlier than taking the traditional

                        program

Eligibility Requirements

ETSU's Undergraduate Catalog lists the following requirements for program eligibility:

Completion of 75 credits in a student's undergraduate program, including credits earned

                        from dual enrollment or advanced placement.

(For transfer students) Completion of at least 2 semesters at ETSU

Acceptance into the accelerated program, including the graduate program, prior to

                        earning the undergraduate degree.

A minimum ETSU undergraduate GPA of 3.25 to request admission.

Satisfaction of requirements for the intended program and the Graduate School (SGS).

Other Considerations

At most twelve (12) credits of graduate work may be counted towards the requirements

                        of both the bachelor and master degrees.

Students must receive a grade of B or better in the courses to apply toward both degrees.

Students whose cumulative undergraduate and graduate GPA falls below the required

                        program minimum must obtain program and graduate school approval to continue in the

                        accelerated program.  Program approval of continuation must be written and copied

                        to the student’s undergraduate and graduate files.

Students who withdraw or are administratively withdrawn from the accelerated program

                        may not subsequently count courses for both degrees; they may count eligible courses

                        toward one degree only.

## Graduate Assistantships

**URL:** https://www.etsu.edu/cbat/computing/graduate_programs/assistantships.php

All of our GA and TS positions for AY 2023-2024 have been filled.

This was a particularly competitive year for awards, due to the unusually large

                     number of applications we've received (around 400) relative to the number of GA positions

                     (10) and TS positions (2) we had to offer.  We regret our inability to provide aid

                     for all who merit it.

One additional source of information on GA and TS positions is graduate school's list

                     of

on-campus GA and TS positions.

In addition to

scholarships

, ETSU's Department of Computing offers graduate assistantships (GAships) and tuition

                     scholarships (TSships) to full-time students, in exchange for half-time work on the

                     Department's behalf.  GA positions include a salary--currently, $5,800 per semester.

GA and TS positions include a tuition benefit. A full GA or TS appointment relieves

                        students of their obligation to pay tuition for all terms in which they hold this

                        appointment.

Eligibility

Students who hold a graduate assistantship (GAship) or tuition scholarship (TSship)

                     in a given semester must enroll as a full-time graduate student at the start of that

                     semester and maintain full-time enrollment until the end of the semester

Students who hold a teaching assistantship (TAship) or research assistantship (RAship)

                     with the Department of Computing must also enroll in one of two classes:

Students with full TA appointments must enroll in CSCI 5019-001 (supervised teaching).

Students with RA appointments must enroll in CSCI 5029-001 (supervised research).

In order to maintain GAships and TSships, students must fulfill their duties as a

                        GA or a TS to their supervisor's satisfaction and maintain a GPA of 3.0 or above.

Duties

Most of the department's GAs serve as teaching assistants (TAs) for the Department's

                        CSCI 1100 (Using Information Technology) freshman-level class.  The department also

                        employs some students as TAs for lower-division computing classes and laboratory assistants.

Deadlines

All students who apply for admission to the M.S. degree program as full-time students

                        are automatically considered for GAships and TSships. As a rule, GAships and TSships

                        are awarded on an annual cycle, starting in fall semester.  Awards, however, are made

                        for spring semester when positions are available, as is frequently the case.

Graduate assistantships and tuition scholarships for fall are typically awarded starting

                        in mid-to-late April.  For full consideration for assistance, students should apply

                        by April 1 for admission for the following fall or November 1 for admission for the

                        following spring semester.

Decisions

The awarding of financial assistance is based on evaluations of people's applications,

                           academic records, and professional and teaching experience.

GAships and TSships, as a rule, are awarded by a departmental subcommittee rather

                        than individual professors.

Do not send CVs, resumes, and requests to individual members of our faculty; these

                           will only be ignored.

Rather, to increase your chances of receiving financial assistance in what has become

                        a competitive process,

Make sure to secure three letters of reference for your application.

The graduate school must receive these before their personnel will process your application.

We require no specific format for these letters; however, do ask recommenders to complete

                                 the ETSU-provided form as part of their recommendations.

Ideally, at least two of these letters should be written by (former) professors who

                                 can speak to your academic performance.

Enclose a curriculum vitae (CV) with your application.

We require no specific format for CVs.

Do make sure, however, that your CV is clear and focused.

Be sure to include relevant professional experience in computing and in teaching.

Ensure that your essay is clear, concise, focused, and speaks to your post-secondary

                           and professional accomplishments and goals for education.

What you did or enjoyed as a child, for example, will likely be ignored.

Do speak to your teaching experience, if you have any; this can be a plus for evaluating

                                 your application.

Other Sources of Aid

ETSU's graduate school

and

College of Business and Technology

are additional sources of aid for our department's M.S. students.  See the relevant

                        web pages for more information.

four semesters

. Most full-time students who start in Fall 2021, for example, will complete by Spring

                        2023.

Additional semesters may be needed by students who either start the program in spring

                        semester, enter with less than the full set of foundation courses, attend part-time,

                        or thesis students requiring additional time to complete their research.

Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics

The graduate certificate in data analytics may be completed in three, if the first

                        two courses in the sequence are taken concurrently; otherwise, four.

## ETSU best in Tennessee for computing degree programs

**URL:** https://www.etsu.edu/etsu-news/2021/06-june/computing-degree-rankings.php

JOHNSON CITY – East Tennessee State University offers the best computing degree programs

                     in Tennessee, according to ranking websites CollegeFactual.com and Universities.com.

                     Both sites recently ranked ETSU the No. 1 “2021 Best College for Computer Information

                     Systems in Tennessee” and the No. 2 “Best Computer and Information Sciences College

                     in Tennessee for 2021,” respectively.

“This recognition underscores the value of an ETSU computing education, as well as

                     the quality and effectiveness of work from both our faculty and our students,” said

                     Dr. Tony Pittarese, department of computing chair and professor. “The department of

                     computing is a place of opportunity for students to learn skills that equip them to

                     go on to have great careers. Our faculty is a diverse group of professionals, focused

                     on student success as we continue to produce graduates that have a positive impact

                     throughout our region and across the country.”

ETSU Department of Computing

offers four undergraduate concentrations: computer science, cybersecurity and modern

                     networks, information systems, and information technology, as well as three graduate-level

                     programs: a Master of Science in computer science or information systems, and a graduate

                     certificate in data analytics.

In March, ETSU announced an accelerated Bachelor of Science degree in computing with

                     a concentration in information systems to serve as the foundation for Chattanooga-based

Tennessee BlueSky Institute

in partnership with BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee. BlueSky will place special

                     focus on identifying and recruiting high-potential students from Hamilton County’s

                     most challenged high schools with classes expected to begin in Summer 2022. Students

                     will complete their coursework on the BlueCross campus, located in Downtown Chattanooga.

                     In addition to hands-on portfolio-building, BlueSky graduates will also earn the opportunity

                     to receive a job offer from BlueCross Blue Shield.

Universities.com

provides potential students with rankings, tuition costs and in-depth information

                     on more than 6,500 colleges and universities in order for them to obtain a maximum

                     return on investment. Rankings are determined and tied together using government data,

                     survey responses, college graduate interviews, and editorial reviews in order to provide

                     a comprehensive evaluation of each school.

CollegeFactual.com

analyzed three colleges and universities that offer a bachelor’s degree in computer

                     information systems based on designated criteria such as graduation rates, overall

                     graduate earnings and other educational resources such as accreditation, major popularity,

                     and major focus versus other majors at the school.
