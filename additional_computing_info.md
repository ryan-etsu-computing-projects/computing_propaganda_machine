ETSU Department of Computing

offers four undergraduate concentrations: computer science, cybersecurity and modern

                     networks, information systems, and information technology, as well as three graduate-level

                     programs: a Master of Science in computer science or information systems, and a graduate

                     certificate in data analytics.

In March, ETSU announced an accelerated Bachelor of Science degree in computing with

                     a concentration in information systems to serve as the foundation for Chattanooga-based

Tennessee BlueSky Institute

in partnership with BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee. BlueSky will place special

                     focus on identifying and recruiting high-potential students from Hamilton County’s

                     most challenged high schools with classes expected to begin in Summer 2022. Students

                     will complete their coursework on the BlueCross campus, located in Downtown Chattanooga.

                     In addition to hands-on portfolio-building, BlueSky graduates will also earn the opportunity

                     to receive a job offer from BlueCross Blue Shield.
